# Findings log (Captum on TorchTPU)

Setup: Cloud TPU v6e-1, us-east5-b, torch 2.15.0, torch_tpu 0.2.0, Captum 0.9.0, transformers 5.22.1.
Scripts: `scripts/tpu_smoke.py`, `scripts/tpu_correctness.py`. Tiny models only (MLP, small CNN, TinyLM).

## 1. Supported (smoke test, 12/12 PASS = no exception)
backward, autograd.grad wrt input, forward hooks, full backward hooks, double backward (create_graph),
custom autograd.Function, torch.func.grad, torch.compile(backend="tpu") + backward on a view input
(open issue #4409 did NOT reproduce on 0.2.0; not yet verified numerically), Captum IntegratedGradients,
LayerIntegratedGradients.

## 2. Numerical agreement vs CPU (fp32, same weights/inputs), max relative error
| Method | default | `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("highest")` |
|---|---|---|
| Saliency | 2.2e-3 | 1.7e-7 |
| InputXGradient | 1.7e-3 | 7.0e-8 |
| IntegratedGradients (50 steps) | 2.1e-3 | 4.4e-8 |
| LayerIntegratedGradients | 3.1e-3 | 1.0e-7 |
| LayerGradCam | 1.0e-2 | 2.2e-7 |
| torchtpu_xai batched IG | 2.1e-3 | 1.0e-7 |
| GradientShap | 3.6e-2 | 2.5e-2 (random sampling differs across devices; expected, not a bug) |

Takeaway: on TPU, fp32 matmuls default to reduced precision ("medium", `Precision.DEFAULT`: bf16 inputs on the
MXU; TorchTPU maintainer cota confirmed the default is "medium", not "high"), which shows up as ~1e-3 relative error in
attributions. Setting matmul precision to "highest" matches CPU to ~1e-7. Attribution users should set it.
Caveat: tiny models; confirm on a real transformer.

## 3. Real model: Qwen3-0.6B, fp32, matmul precision "highest" (`scripts/hf_captum_bench.py`)
Captum `LayerIntegratedGradients` on the embedding layer, 5-token prompt "The capital of France is",
target " Paris", 32 steps:
- captum CPU vs captum TPU: max rel err **8.5e-6**; same top-3 tokens (" France", " of", "The").
  -> Captum works unmodified on a real transformer on TorchTPU, with CPU-level numerics.
- torchtpu_xai IG vs captum CPU: max rel err 7.1e-1 -> under investigation (Captum defaults to
  Gauss-Legendre quadrature, mine is right-Riemann; or a bug). See `scripts/hf_ig_diag_bench.py diag`.
- TorchTPU warns that "highest" precision "may be significantly lower" performance; benchmark "high" too.

Timing (seconds, warm median; first run incl. compile in parens), same 5-token prompt:
| steps | captum cpu | captum tpu | xai tpu eager |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8  | 0.57 | 0.57 (1.35) | 0.50 (0.54) |
| 32 | 0.83 | 0.57 (0.50) | 0.53 (0.60) |
| 64 | 1.10 | 0.60 (1.88) | 0.58 (0.64) |
TPU time is flat in steps (~0.55 s) -> dominated by fixed overhead at this tiny size, not compute.
Only ~2x over CPU at 64 steps. Need longer prompts / more steps / compile to show real advantage.

## 4. Correction to the pitch
Captum's IntegratedGradients already runs all n_steps in ONE batched forward/backward when
`internal_batch_size` is None (it expands inputs to n_steps x batch). So "batch IG steps into one
fixed-shape call" is not a differentiator over Captum; the timing parity (captum tpu ~= xai tpu) confirms it.
Project repositioned: TorchTPU support *in Captum* (full-method compat matrix, fixes upstreamed as PRs,
TPU test path, "Captum on TPUs" tutorial incl. the matmul-precision finding). torchtpu_xai -> helpers only.

## 5. IG discrepancy resolved: not a bug, IG does not converge on Qwen3 with a pad baseline
`scripts/hf_ig_diag_bench.py diag`, Qwen3-0.6B fp32 "highest", prompt "The capital of France is", target " Paris",
baseline = pad token ids:
- Same rule, same steps: torchtpu_xai IG == Captum `method="riemann_right"` to the printed digit
  (steps=32: sum -11.3576 / delta 28.51 both; steps=128: sum 35.8381 / delta 18.69 both). Implementation is correct.
- torchtpu_xai IG cpu vs tpu (32 steps): rel err 1.4e-4 (highest precision).
- The reference itself is not converged: Captum CPU gausslegendre **256 steps has convergence delta 27.3 against
  a total attribution of 44.4**. Sums swing -26.6 -> -8.2 -> +44.4 across 32/128/256 steps.
  => For LLMs, raw-logit target + pad-token baseline is a poor IG setup; always print `return_convergence_delta`.
  Try log-softmax target, zero-embedding baseline, more steps / `internal_batch_size`. Not TPU-specific.
- Decision: drop torchtpu_xai IG as a product; keep its convergence check as a test utility.

## 6. IG scaling on Qwen3-0.6B, 53-token prompt (`hf_ig_diag_bench.py bench`, precision "highest")
| steps | captum cpu | captum tpu eager | xai tpu eager | xai tpu `torch.compile(backend="tpu")` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | 4.28 s | 0.86 s (first 3.2) | 0.62 s | **0.13 s** (first run 112 s = compile) |
| 128 | 16.39 s | **1.17 s** (first 3.1) = 14x CPU | OOM | OOM |
OOM (xai variants only): "Attempting to allocate 3.84G ... 1.04G free" = the full logits tensor [128, 53, 151936]
fp32 held alongside the [128, 53, 1024] interpolation path with grad. Captum's LIG survived 128 steps because it
chunks internally via `internal_batch_size=steps`... but every LLM attribution still materialises [B, T, V] logits
before selecting `[:, -1, target]`; `model(..., logits_to_keep=1)` (transformers v5) removes that. After the OOM the
process was left with ~141 MB HBM free ("Error loading program tt_jit_mul"), so later rows in that process are invalid.
TPU first-compile is 112 s; tier-2 compile cache is disabled for single-device programs, so every new process pays it
(tier-3 GCS cache `TORCH_TPU_TIER3_COMPILATION_CACHE_ROOT=gs://...` would avoid this).
Precision "high" (warm s): captum tpu 0.880 / 1.078 at 32 / 128 steps; xai compile 0.102. => matmul precision is
not the bottleneck for eager attribution; "highest" costs ~nothing here. Compile first-run 68 s at "high".

**DeferAndFuse (`TORCH_TPU_DEFER_AND_FUSE=1`, precision high), warm s:**
| steps | captum cpu | captum tpu strict eager | captum tpu DeferAndFuse | xai compile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | 4.48 | 0.880 | **0.238** (first run 26 s) | 0.176 |
| 128 | 17.04 | 1.078 | **0.450** (first run 29 s) | - |
DeferAndFuse makes *unmodified Captum* 3.7x faster than strict eager and **38x faster than CPU** at 128 steps, with
no code change: one env var. Cost: ~26-29 s fusion compile on first call. This is the headline perf finding.
256 steps fail everywhere (full [256,53,151936] logits = 8 GB) -> `scripts/hf_ig_bench2.py` with logits_to_keep=1 queued.

## 7. Captum's own test configs on TPU (device-generic suite, `CAPTUM_TEST_DEVICE=tpu`)
266 generated tests (78 configs x algorithms), Captum 0.9.0, torch_tpu 0.2.0, precision "highest": **262 passed, 4 failed** in 5m25s.
- 1 tolerance miss: `basic_multi_input_dl_shap_DeepLiftShap`, values +6.1e-5 vs -6.1e-5 (|diff| 1.2e-4 > dp_delta 1e-4) at a
  near-zero attribution. Precision noise, not a method bug.
- 3 real gaps (fixed by torch_tpu#6105): `conv_layer_single_target_LayerDeepLift`, `conv_neuron_NeuronDeepLift`, `conv_neuron_slice_selector_NeuronDeepLift`
  all fail with **`RuntimeError: operator 'aten::max_unpool2d' is not implemented for TPU`**. DeepLift's MaxPool rule calls
  `F.max_unpool2d`. => missing op lowering in torch_tpu; file / implement.

## 7b. Full captum.attr method matrix on TPU (`scripts/captum_tpu_matrix.py`, MLP + small CNN, precision "highest")
**27 OK, 11 RUNS (stochastic, run-only), 0 DIFF, 0 FAIL** (first pass had Lime/KernelShap failing only for a missing `sklearn`).
Every deterministic method matches CPU to 1e-7..1e-8 relative: IG, Saliency, InputXGradient, DeepLift, GuidedBackprop,
Deconvolution, GuidedGradCam, FeatureAblation, Occlusion, ShapleyValues, LRP, and all Layer*/Neuron* variants incl.
LayerGradCam, LayerLRP, LayerFeatureAblation, NeuronConductance. Stochastic methods (GradientShap, ShapleyValueSampling,
NoiseTunnel, *Shap) run but differ as expected from RNG. The fix for #6036 passes its regression test (3 passed) on the
from-source wheel.

## 8. torch_tpu #6036 confirmed, and attribution triggers it
0.2.0 wheel, `scripts/scalar_leak_check.py`: same scalar x5000 -> +2 live allocations; new scalar each x5000 -> **+4999**;
`empty_cache()` releases none. Captum IG, same n_steps x20 -> +0; **n_steps 10..109 -> +6361** (each n_steps yields new
step-size floats, each a leaked 0-d buffer). Fix: bounded cache in `MakeBuffer` (PR google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6102). Patched wheel, same script: new scalar x5000 -> **+903**
(1024-entry cache cleared 4x), Captum n_steps sweep -> **+280** (was +6361); regression test `tests/scalar_buffer_cache_test.py` 3 passed; rebuilt after merging main (ba59861): same numbers, 3 passed.
On unpatched current main the strict-eager case no longer leaks (main's transfer refactor), DeferAndFuse still does (+5001).
From-source wheel (cp314) only imports with the torch version pinned in the repo lockfile (2.11.0+cpu / 2.14.0+cpu),
not latest 2.15: the versioned .so loader picks `glue_2_14_0` and fails with `undefined symbol c10::report_overflow`.

## 9. Other findings from the queue
- `torch.accelerator.current_accelerator()` -> `tpu`, is_available True, device_count 1: torch_tpu registers properly.
- IG with `logits_to_keep=1`, 53 tokens: 128 steps in ONE batch = 0.857 s warm on TPU vs 11.2 s CPU (13x), peak HBM 23.9 GB
  (8.0 GB at 32 steps). 256 steps OOMs on v6e-1 (32 GB) -> use `internal_batch_size` beyond ~128 steps.
- Captum + `torch.compile(backend="tpu")` through HF's `input_ids` path fails: "expected tensor to be on tpu, got cpu" for a
  shape-[2] int64 graph input (HF-created index tensor). Compiled mode needs all tensor args on device. The
  `inputs_embeds` path (our earlier 0.10 s result) avoids it.
- Other libraries (`scripts/other_xai_libs_tpu.py`): shap DeepExplainer/GradientExplainer PASS, pytorch-grad-cam GradCAM/ScoreCAM PASS,
  nnsight trace with `device_map="tpu"` PASS. Inseq FAIL `ValueError: Unknown device tpu` (device allow-list -> small upstream PR).
  TransformerLens FAIL `transformers has no attribute TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` (transformers v5 incompatibility, not TPU).
- End-to-end demo (`scripts/demo_captum_qwen_tpu.py`): `device_map="tpu"` load 2.9 s; LIG 64 steps 2.0 s incl. compile;
  `LLMAttribution(FeatureAblation)` 9.9 s; `LLMGradientAttribution(LIG)` 0.89 s. All Captum LLM APIs work on TPU.
- #4408 guard (`scripts/compile_nan_check.py`, Qwen3 sdpa, d logit/d embeds): no NaN in eager or compiled; compiled vs CPU rel err
  1.85e-5, eager vs CPU 2.76e-5. Does not reproduce on 0.2.0 / torch 2.15.
- Compile + Captum: a plain `torch.compile(model, backend="tpu")(input_ids=..., logits_to_keep=1)` call works; the failure above
  only appears when Captum's LIG wraps the compiled model (its forward hooks / index tensors), so it is a Captum+compile interaction.
- XProf (`scripts/profile_ig_modes.py`, LIG 32 steps, torch.profiler with ProfilerActivity.TPU): strict eager Self CPU 1.93 s, of
  which `aten::_to_copy` is 70% (1.35 s, 522 calls, 2.6 ms avg = host<->device copies that block); DeferAndFuse Self CPU 0.78 s,
  `_to_copy` 0.29 s (0.57 ms avg). Self TPU 5.0 s vs 1.23 s. Traces in `~/prof/{strict,daf}/` on the VM. Compiled mode fails as above.
- Missing op filed: google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6103 (`aten::max_unpool2d`, repro `scripts/max_unpool2d_repro.py`).

## Upstream status
- meta-pytorch/captum#1951 (device-generic accelerator tests) - open, needs Meta CLA + maintainer CI approval.
- google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6102 (bounded scalar buffer cache, fixes #6036) - open, needs Google CLA.
- google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6103 (max_unpool2d missing) - filed, then implemented in google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6105
  (native StableHLO batched scatter; 25 unit + 4 error tests pass on v6e; Captum's 3 DeepLift conv configs now pass).

## 10. Explainability example across execution modes (`upstream/torch_tpu` branch `explainability-example`)
`examples/explainability/captum_attribution.py`, Qwen3-0.6B LIG, 42-token prompt, 64 steps, fp32 "highest", v6e-1:
| mode | warm median | first call | max rel err vs CPU | peak HBM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| strict eager | 0.80 s | 5 s | 9.2e-05 | 10.6 GiB |
| DeferAndFuse | 0.36 s | 43 s | 9.3e-05 | 11.1 GiB |
| torch.compile(backend="tpu") (patched Captum #1952 + torch_tpu #6106, env_fix) | 0.16 s | 130 s | 7.0e-05 | 15.3 GiB |
Tiny MLP IG: 0.065 s strict / 0.039 s DaF / 0.062 s compile, rel err 2e-7 in all modes. 128 steps with
`internal_batch_size=64`: 1.42 s, rel err 5.5e-4, peak 10.6 GiB. Numbers taken while a bazel build loaded the host CPU;
CPU reference timings from that run (67 s) are not usable.

## 11. Missing-ops batch (`upstream/torch_tpu` branch `missing-ops-batch`)
smooth_l1_loss(+backward), huber_loss(+backward), logaddexp, logaddexp2, nansum, std_mean, trace, addbmm implemented;
53 new unit tests pass on v6e against a wheel built from the branch; the probe over `UNREGISTERED_OPS` shows all eight dispatch.
Lesson: TorchTPU forbids new composite kernels. `OpNameStack` aborts with "CompositeOpCheck: Op X is decomposed into Y"
when a TT_KERNEL calls another ATen op, and `known_composite_ops` is capped at 150 entries. nansum/trace/std_mean/addbmm were
first written as at::-composites (built fine, crashed at runtime) and rewritten as StableHLO lowerings.
Also: `IgnoreInCacheKey` rejects `PromotedScalar` (already excluded from keys); `UnaryOpOptions` needs
`.op_param_cache_keys` set (no default ctor); TPU matmul tests need `set_float32_matmul_precision("highest")`.
Still unregistered after this batch (probe): triu_indices, median/nanmedian/mode/kthvalue, frexp, renorm, and `.out` variants of
hypot, copysign, erfc, sinc, mish, index_select, heaviside, nextafter, range, logspace, hardshrink.

## 12. Bounded-dynamism deny-list triage (`upstream/torch_tpu` branch `dynamism-denylist-triage`)
Ran 12 "untriaged: invalid result" entries of `tests/dynamism_test_utils.py` with their skips removed, via
`bazel test //tests:ops_test_dynamic_tpu-v6e` and `..._compiled_tpu-v6e` (all dtypes, 1 sample/op, `--local_test_jobs=1`;
parallel shards fail with "Failed to acquire a TPU device node /dev/vfio/0"). eq, maximum, ne, neg, pow, remainder, round, sign,
sinh, sub, trunc pass in both modes -> entries removed. clamp fails: `clamp.Tensor` (tensor min/max) mismatches 80% of elements
with any dim bounded (eager), scalar variants pass -> moved to a diagnosed reason. clamp_min left untriaged.

## Upstream status (continued)
- google-pytorch/torch_tpu#6106 (CPU view args in split compile) - open, CI green.
- meta-pytorch/captum#1952 (LIG cumsum as Python ints) - open.
- #4408 triage comment posted (no NaN on 0.2.0; compiled/CPU rel err 1.85e-5).
- Branches pushed, PR creation blocked by GitHub: `docs-memory-apis`, `loader-import-error-context`, `missing-ops-batch`,
  `explainability-example`, `dynamism-denylist-triage`. Retried 2026-11-01 09:35 (+03): GraphQL `createPullRequest` still refused,
  REST `POST /pulls` returns 404, while a no-op PATCH of our own PR #6106 succeeds and rate limits are untouched. So the account can
  write to the repo but not open PRs there; fork PR creation works. Root cause (web compare page, 2026-11-01): "Users without write access can have up to 3 pull requests open at a time" on this
  repository; #6102, #6105 and #6106 fill the quota. The remaining five wait until one of those is merged or closed.
- google-cla[bot] on #6102: CLA not yet signed; the check fails until it is.
- Issues filed 2026-11-01 to claim the blocked branches: #6111 missing-ops-batch, #6112 dynamism-denylist-triage,
  #6113 loader-import-error-context, #6114 explainability-example; docs-memory-apis is a comment on #4413.
- PR #6106 retitled "Fix compiled TPU partitions reading CPU view arguments past their buffer".
- Approach comments posted on #6111-#6114 (`comment_61xx_approach.md`). Self-assignment is impossible: GitHub only allows
  collaborators/org members as assignees (`/repos/.../assignees/joinalahmed` -> 404) and the repo has no `/assign` bot; each
  comment asks a maintainer to assign.

## 12b. Review feedback on the missing-ops batch (2026-11-02)
- Maintainer adivinpatel04 on #6111: one issue per op, and the batch branch is not of reviewable quality. Replied, closed #6111,
  filed #6118 for `logaddexp.out` alone with branch `logaddexp` on the fork (9 files, +211/-1). Self-review found one semantic
  bug in the batch version: `force_float_inputs = true` promoted integer inputs, while ATen raises NotImplementedError for them;
  the single-op branch raises. Dropped the out-device/alias checks that `BinaryOpOut` already performs. PR blocked by the
  3-open-PR limit.
- Built and tested on a v6e-1 (asia-south1-b, 2026-11-02; on-demand capacity failed in six other zones and queued requests in
  us-east5-b died with a Google-side internal error). Two fixes came out of the first build: the stablehlo builders take
  `MlirOp&` and reject temporaries, so every intermediate is now a named lvalue (dc01e924d); and the kernel macro prefixes error
  messages with `logaddexp(): `, which the errors test now expects (ad18185ce). Final run (`results/logaddexp_v6e1_run3.txt`):
  semantics match CPU on 0, +-1, +-100, +-inf, mixed inf and nan (`allclose(equal_nan=True)` True); integer inputs raise
  NotImplementedError; bazel `ops_unit_test_tpu-v6e`, `errors_test_tpu`, `ops_test_tpu-v6e` all PASSED with `--test_filter=*logaddexp*`.
  `errors_test.py` cannot run under plain pytest (absl flags unparsed); bazel is the authoritative runner.
- Main wheel build from a cold disk cache took 37 min on the v6e-1 (44 vCPU); the branch rebuild took 4 min on top of it.
  `attach-disk` failed with an internal error in this project, so the build ran on the 100 GB boot disk (60% used after both builds).
- Maintainer adivinpatel04 on #6118 (2026-11-02 17:35 UTC): hold off on new op issues and PRs until #6105 (max_unpool, issue
  #6103) merges; ops are reviewed sequentially so feedback carries forward. PR #6130 for logaddexp was opened before that comment
  was read and closed the same day with a note; it reopens after #6105 lands with its review feedback applied.
- #6102 (scalar buffer cache bound) closed as a duplicate of apullin's #6037, filed two days earlier with the same 1024-entry
  clear-on-full design. Maintainer cota invited improvements to #6037.
- Remaining ops go one at a time after #6118 is reviewed: logaddexp2, smooth_l1_loss, huber_loss, nansum, std_mean, trace, addbmm.

## 13. Multi-chip validation on a v6e-4 (us-east5-b, 2026-11-01)
Capacity: on-demand and spot v5litepod-4/8 and v6e-4/8 were unavailable in us-east5-b and us-central1-a all morning
("Insufficient capacity"); a v5litepod-8 is also over the 4-chip per-zone serving quota. A queued v6e-4 landed after ~3 h.
Setup/test scripts: `scripts/vm_multichip_setup.sh`, `scripts/vm_multichip_tests.sh`, `scripts/captum_multichip_ig.py`.
- Process model: libtpu is exclusive per process; a second process touching the TPU fails with "The TPU is already in use by
  process with pid N". Multi-chip means one torchrun worker per chip (`eval $(python -m torch.tpu.distributed | sed 's/^/export /')`,
  `torchrun --nproc_per_node=$WORLD_SIZE`); each worker sees `device_count() == 1`. `TPU_VISIBLE_CHIPS`-style variables do nothing.
- Attribution matrix on chip 0 (`results/v6e-4/matrix_chip0.txt`): 27 OK, 11 RUNS, 0 DIFF/FAIL, identical to the v6e-1.
- IG sharded across 4 chips with `tpu_dist` all_reduce (`results/v6e-4/multichip_ig.md`): 64 steps 0.355 s vs 0.219 s on one chip
  (0.62x, the problem is too small to split); 256 steps 0.327 s vs 0.547 s with `internal_batch_size=64` (1.67x) and OOM for a
  single 256 batch on one chip; agreement with Captum 5.6e-8 at equal batch size, 1.2e-4 otherwise.
- From-source wheel on the 4-chip host: `torch_tpu-0.2.1-cp314` (hermetic default Python is 3.14), needs torch 2.11.0+cpu,
  `libtpu`, `pyzmq`, `expecttest`/`hypothesis` for the in-repo tests, and `_internal/utils/test_utils.py` copied from `src/` (the
  wheel omits test helpers). Each branch rebuild from the main cache takes ~9 min on 180 vCPUs.
- Branch results (`results/v6e-4/branches/`, variant `_tpu-v6e`, `--local_test_jobs=1`, each branch rebuilt from source on the host):

  | branch | bazel (as CI runs it) | pytest against the installed wheel |
  |---|---|---|
  | fix-scalar-buffer-cache-bound | - | `scalar_buffer_cache_test.py` 3 passed; leak counts identical to v6e-1 (+2 / +903 / +0 / +280) |

  | docs-memory-apis | - | memory_allocated / max_memory_allocated / memory_reserved / get_memory_info / hbm_bytes_per_device all return sane values |
  | explainability-example | - | strict, DeferAndFuse, compile: all run, max rel err vs CPU 2.0e-7 |

  Two sessions ran the loop concurrently for ~3 minutes (racing the checkout, bazel lock and exclusive TPU); that pass was
  discarded (`multichip_summary_collided.log`).
- At ~11:45 the host-side TPU session manager started refusing every process: libtpu logs `tpunetd_client ... MaybeInitializeSliceBuilder
  failed: GRPC_ERROR START_SESSION failed. Contact GCE with UUID ...`. A guest reboot and a `tpu-runtime.service` restart did not clear it,
  `gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm stop` is not supported for queued-resource nodes, and the node still reports HEALTHY. The last thing that
  touched the TPU before the failure was a 4-worker torchrun from an env whose `libtpu` had just been downgraded to 0.0.50 by the repo
  requirements lock (the released env uses 0.0.51); whether that is cause or coincidence is unknown. Retried every ~3 min for 35 min
  with no recovery; the node was deleted at 12:20 UTC on 2026-11-01. Build disks kept.
- A second v6e-4 was queued with the cache disk and landed at 13:45 UTC (fresh boot disk; setup from the disk cache took 7 min, each
  branch rebuild ~9 min). The items the wedged host had blocked all completed (`results/v6e-4/run2/`): the pytest halves of
  max-unpool2d (25 passed) and missing-ops-batch (53 passed) once `attrs` and `cattrs` were added to the from-source env,
  `//tests/compile:split_compile_test` for the CPU-view branch (PASSED), and the per-chip torchrun leak check, where all four ranks
  report the same counts as the single chip (+2 / +903 / +0 / +280). The table above reflects the final state. The same libtpu
  0.0.51 was used in both envs this time and the host stayed healthy, which is weak evidence for the 0.0.50-downgrade theory above.
  Still uncovered: a v5e-8 (quota) and `tests/distributed/`. The second node and both build disks were deleted at ~18:15 UTC on
  2026-11-01; nothing from this work is billing.

## 14. Remaining ops, one branch each, built and tested on a v6e-1 (asia-south1-b, 2026-11-02/03)
Maintainer adivinpatel04 asked on #6118 to hold new op issues and PRs until #6105 merges, so these are fork branches
only, each a single commit on `988b22f12` (`build-base`): the last upstream main that builds from source on the VM.
Current main (b6224d2f0, after "Update Bazel to 9.3.1 and rules_python to 2.4.5") fails in `csrc/ops/xla_utils.cc`
because the torch 2.16 wheel's bundled protobuf headers shadow XLA's. Each branch: kernel dir mirroring the nearest
kernel on main, `op_names.h`, eager registration, `native_functions_data.py`, `ops_unit_test.py`, `errors_test.py`,
plus a TPU-vs-CPU check script in `scripts/checks/`. Runner: `scripts/vm_branch_tests.sh BRANCH FILTER CHECK`.

| Branch | Head | Semantics vs CPU | pytest | bazel ops_unit / errors / ops | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `logaddexp2` | 458c993eb | 9 values incl. +-inf, nan; bf16; broadcast | 2 passed | PASSED x3 | int64 -> NotImplementedError |
| `std_mean` | 043c512a2 | 13 cases incl. correction >= N (nan + warning), bf16 | 38 passed | PASSED x3 | mirrors var_mean |
| `nansum` | 270b400be | 13 cases incl. all-NaN rows, int/bool -> int64, empty | 2 passed | PASSED x3 (+ tpu_errors_test) | complex rejected (CUDA accepts) |
| `trace` | 6d357d9ff | square/wide/tall/0x0/1x1, bf16, int32 -> int64 | 3 passed | PASSED x3 | CPU torch 2.11 has no bf16 trace; test uses f32 reference |
| `addbmm` | 787fbd438 | 11 cases incl. beta=0 ignores NaN, empty batch, broadcast, in-place | 10 passed | PASSED x3 | mirrors baddbmm |
| `smooth_l1_loss` | adf1a4009 | fwd+bwd, 3 reductions, bf16, beta=0, boundary, broadcast | 21 passed | PASSED x3 (+ tpu_errors_test) | functional op checks beta before dispatch; test calls `.out` |
| `huber_loss` | 9ffd2719d | fwd+bwd, 3 reductions, bf16, boundary, broadcast; delta <= 0 rejected | 21 passed | PASSED x3 | |

Raw summaries: `results/<branch>_v6e1.txt`, `results/final_steps_v6e1.txt`. Build time per branch ~27 min (op_names.h
touches many TUs), tests ~15 min.

Fixes found only by building: stablehlo builders take `MlirOp&` (temporaries fail to compile); the kernel macro prefixes
error messages with `op(): `; `torch.nn.functional.smooth_l1_loss` validates beta itself, so the kernel check is only
reachable through `aten.smooth_l1_loss.out`.

### #6106 review (apullin, 2026-11-02): preserve CPU argument strides
Forcing `contiguous_format` changed the strides of transposed and channels_last CPU arguments, so views inside the TPU
partition (as_strided, t().reshape, permute().reshape) gave wrong values or failed to compile; four cases pass on main
and broke with the PR. Fix (de1abb50c on the PR branch): `torch.empty_like(arg)` (preserve_format) for compile metadata
and plain `.to(device)` at run time; both give storage offset 0 and keep dense strides. Verified on the v6e-1 with caches
off: original repro (4 cases) and the four reported cases all match CPU (`scripts/checks/check_cpu_view_args.py`, 8/8);
`tests/compile/split_compile_test.py` 18 passed incl. the new `test_cpu_argument_strides_are_preserved`; bazel target PASSED.
Negative confirmation (`results/cpuview_negative_v6e1.txt`, same script, same VM): on the contiguous_format revision
c32405eea the four reported cases fail exactly as described (f1 and f2 return the transposed values, f3 and f4 fail to
compile with the quoted `view()` errors) while the original repro passes, 4/8; on base main f7172418b the original
repro fails (`x * cum[1]` gives zeros, `x + cum[1]` gives `x`) while the four stride cases pass, 5/8. Only the fix
passes 8/8.

## 15. Full regression suites before any further PR push (2026-11-03)
After the #6106 stride regression, every PR and every branch gets the full upstream-style test run, diffed against its
base, before it is pushed again.

**Captum (done).** `tests/attr` with `pytest -n 8` on CPU (`scripts/vm_captum_tests.sh`), upstream `master` b89cccbe
(Captum develops on `master`; its `main` is years stale and a first comparison against it was discarded) vs the
#1951 branch `tpu-accelerator-tests` (254508ef) and the #1952 branch `lig-cumsum-python-ints` (4a3aab19), each one
commit ahead of that master: 783 tests each, identical pass/fail sets. The 76 failures and 23 errors are pre-existing on
master in this environment (vLLM provider tests, KernelSHAP random baselines, Lime, data-parallel). Files:
`results/captum_suite/`.

**torch_tpu (running).** `scripts/vm_full_suite.sh REV LABEL` on the v6e-1: builds the `requires-tpu*` targets under
`//tests/...` and runs them with the `ci_tpu_v6` tag set minus the multi-chip, v5p and v7x tags, one test at a time,
714 test targets per revision, one `//target STATUS` line each in `~/fullsuite_LABEL.results`. `scripts/vm_suite_chain.sh`
queues revisions by PID wait. Order (grouped by XLA pin): #6106 base f7172418b and head de1abb50c; #6105 base 99aa3d587
and head 73321c439; `988b22f12`; then the seven op branches of §14. Results land here as they finish.

Three lessons from getting that to run on a 100 GB boot disk: (1) the VM checkout had f7172418b's XLA pin and generated
docs left behind as uncommitted changes, so the first baseline was "988b22f12 + newer XLA"; the script now does
`git checkout -f` plus `git clean` and logs `git status`. (2) The C++ unit tests under `//csrc/...` build XLA again under
a configuration transition (~30 GB) and are skipped. (3) Every `py_test` gets a runfiles tree of ~100 MB of symlinks (one
4 KB block each), ~50 GB for the whole set, so the tests run in chunks of 40 with the runfiles trees deleted between
chunks. `--test_summary=terse` lists only failures; `short` is needed for a diffable list.

**Capacity.** Flex-Start, as support suggested, is not usable in this project today: every v6e Flex-Start or Spot request
(Compute Engine `instances create` and `gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources create --provisioning-model=flex-start`)
returns "Write access to project denied: please check billing account associated" with billing enabled; v5litepod-8
exceeds the 4-chip preemptible quota per zone; the one accepted v5litepod-4 request (us-west4-a) failed in provisioning
with an internal error. Everything runs on the single v6e-1.

## 12c. Maintainer feedback on the write-up (cota, 2026-11-03)
#6114 (explainability example + case study) was closed as not planned: in-tree `docs/` and `examples/` stay limited to
first-party workflows testable in internal CI, no third-party deps; bug reports and narrow fixes such as #6106 remain
welcome. The maintainers also asked to spread submissions over time. Two corrections to apply to anything published: the
default float32 matmul precision is `"medium"` / `Precision.DEFAULT` (our text said "reduced precision, bf16 inputs",
which is that mode, now named explicitly), and the eager mode can be switched in-process with
`torch.tpu.set_eager_mode(torch.tpu.EagerMode.DEFER_AND_FUSE)`, not only through the env var at import. Fixed on the fork
branch `explainability-example` (c6ac51ffb), in the dev.to draft and above in §1.

## TODO
- Captum LIG + torch.compile(backend="tpu"): find which CPU index tensor reaches the compiled graph; fix in Captum or document.
- Inseq device allow-list PR; torch_tpu examples/docs entry; precision-guide numbers (#5727); #4409 triage comment.

## #6105 review rework (2026-11-05)

basioli-k's nine inline comments on `max_unpool_aten_kernels.cc` are addressed in d4c4bd843 (local, on
`max-unpool2d`, not pushed): the lowering now calls `BuildScatterShlo(..., ScatterOp::kReplace)`;
validation is split into `ValidateMaxUnpoolInputs` (Status) and `ComputeOutputDimensions`
(`ConcreteSizeToDimensions`); `MaxUnpoolOut` writes into `out` and the non-out kernels allocate
`MakeEmptyTensor({0})` and call it; the explicit resize stays only on the zero-size path (`DispatchOpOut`
resizes itself); `NumElements` replaces the hand-rolled products. Input dtype is now floating-point only,
matching CPU torch 2.11, where bool, every integer dtype, complex64 and float8 all fail with
`"max_unpool2d" not implemented for '...'`. New test `test_max_unpool2d_non_floating_point_input`.
Draft replies: `comment_6105_review_replies.md`. Patch: `pr6105_rework.patch` (untracked).

Testing: the VM was mid-chain (logaddexp2 run, six op branches queued). The chain loop was stopped and
`scripts/vm_pr6105_rework.sh` queued on the VM: it waits for the logaddexp2 run by PID, checks out
`origin/max-unpool2d` plus the patch, builds a wheel (different XLA pin from build-base, so XLA rebuilds),
runs `ops_unit_test -k unpool`, `errors_test -k max_unpool2d` and the three bazel targets with
`--test_filter=*unpool*`, then restarts the chain with std_mean, nansum, trace, addbmm, smooth_l1_loss,
huber_loss. Output: `~/pr6105_rework.summary` (ends with ALL DONE), `~/results_pr6105_rework.txt`.
Lesson: inside `gcloud ... ssh --command`, `pgrep -f PATTERN` matches the `bash -c` wrapper itself unless
the pattern is anchored (`^bash /home/...`).

Update 09:40 UTC: the user chose to interrupt the logaddexp2 run instead of waiting. The interrupt went
wrong once: an unanchored `pkill -f "bazel test ..."` inside `gcloud ssh --command` matched the ssh `bash -c`
wrapper and killed the session; gcloud retried the command, and because killing the waiter fired its EXIT
trap, the chain had restarted and each retry killed the next branch's run until the chain was exhausted
(no results lost: those runs had only just started). Six orphaned bazel clients were killed by PID and the
waiter relaunched with all seven branches queued after the rework test. Lessons: use `[p]attern` or `^bash
/path` in pgrep/pkill over ssh; an EXIT trap also fires on SIGTERM, so a "restart the queue when done" trap
needs a normal-exit flag.

Update 11:10 UTC: ops_test verified to have no max_unpool entry (the earlier `TestOps.test_max_unpool` run executed 0
tests). With the user's go-ahead, d4c4bd843 was pushed to fork/max-unpool2d (PR #6105 head), replies posted on all nine
of basioli-k's threads, and the PR description updated (BuildScatterShlo lowering, floating-point-only input dtype,
five error tests, test plan at d4c4bd843). No ops_test entry added, per the user.

Update 12:30 UTC: the `cla/google` check failed on d4c4bd843 because of a `Co-Authored-By: ... <noreply@anthropic.com>`
trailer (the CLA bot checks co-author emails). Commit message amended to the `Assisted-by:` line only and force-pushed
as 2bdaa6b34 (identical tree); PR body and the first reply now cite 2bdaa6b34. Rule: no Co-Authored-By on CLA repos.

Update 13:40 UTC: the "GitHub Actions Scan" (zizmor, a Google org-level workflow on pull_request_target) failed on
2bdaa6b34 because its check-changes job diffs base..head and the branch was 105 commits behind main, so seven workflow
files changed on main appeared as "changed" and triggered a scan of main's own workflows (exit 14, medium/high findings
not related to the PR). Merging origin/main into max-unpool2d (1dff529c6, no conflicts) empties that diff; the scan
now skips, cla/google passes. Lesson: keep PR branches current with main or the org scan fires on unrelated workflows.

## Scalar cache follow-up (2026-11-05, after #6102 closed as duplicate of #6037)

#6037 landed as 1e71c2b51 (full clear at 1024 entries). Candidate follow-up on branch `scalar-cache-sweep`
(eea94500f): when full, erase only entries whose DeviceBufferList use_count()==1, clear as fallback. Answers
benawilson's review note (a full clear can break dedup of a scalar reused inside a fused region). Expected
gain is small unless measured otherwise, so `scripts/scalar_cache_bench.py` runs on the VM via
`scripts/vm_scalar_cache_bench.sh`: hit/miss/cycle dispatch latency per mode, a fused-region scenario that
reuses 0.9 around an eviction (compile count), and AdamW+cosine (compile count, ms/step, live allocations),
on a wheel from upstream main and on main+patch. The logaddexp2 suite run was interrupted at the user's
request for this; all seven branches are re-queued after the benchmark. Tests for the PR are drafted in
`tests/accelerator_api_test.py` on the branch (eviction survival via allocation deltas, hit-path reuse).

## 2026-11-05 17:40 UTC — scalar-cache benchmark: upstream main no longer builds on the VM; rerun on 988b22f12

- Both wheel builds in `vm_scalar_cache_bench.sh` (upstream main 92b197376 and
  main + sweep patch) failed in ~4 min with clang errors inside torch 2.16.0's
  bundled protobuf headers (`PROTOBUF_PREDICT_FALSE`, `PROTOBUF_NODISCARD`,
  `uint8_t` undeclared in `google/protobuf/stubs/stringpiece.h` and
  `io/coded_stream.h`) while compiling `csrc/ops/xla_utils.cc`. Main now pins
  torch 2.16.0 for Python 3.14; the VM toolchain compiles the 2.11 pin fine.
  Not investigated further; the chain branches and #6105 are on the 2.11 pin.
- `vm_scalar_cache_bench2.sh` (twogen on main) would have failed the same way;
  killed it at 17:35 UTC. Its EXIT trap restarted the chain (pid 2798866,
  logaddexp2 build) which `vm_scalar_cache_bench3.sh` stopped two minutes later.
- Workaround: benchmark on 988b22f12 (last build-base; same XLA pin as the chain
  branches, torch 2.11, ancestor of the landed clear 1e71c2b51). Local branches
  bench-base (988b22f12 + cherry-pick 1e71c2b51 = 4e55a35b3), bench-sweep
  (6423248dc) and bench-twogen (237262803); patches p_clear/p_sweep/p_twogen.
  Job: `~/vm_scalar_cache_bench3.sh 988b22f12 <chain REV LABEL ...>`, started
  17:36:07 UTC, pid 2827306. Writes `~/bench_{clear,sweep,twogen}.txt` and
  `~/scalar_bench3.summary`; trap does bazel clean and restarts the chain with
  all seven branches.
- Lesson: killing a waiter whose EXIT trap restarts the chain immediately
  restarts the chain; stop the chain again (or edit the trap) before the next
  job. Killing job2 only once was fine here because job3 stops the chain itself.

## 2026-11-05 18:20 UTC — root cause of the main build failure: unsandboxed build + torch's bundled protobuf headers

- Every torch wheel ships protobuf 3.x headers under `torch/include/google/protobuf`,
  and the torch hub's `torch_headers` rule adds `torch/include` to the include path.
  Main (rules_python 2.4.6, `bazel/pip_parse_targets.bzl`) excludes those files from
  the declared hdrs "so they do not shadow @com_google_protobuf in sandboxed/remote
  builds" — which only helps when the compiler cannot see undeclared files.
- `--config=no_rbe` → `--config=local` → `--spawn_strategy=standalone`. Unsandboxed,
  clang sees the whole repo dir, so XLA's protobuf-33.6 generated `xla_data.pb.h`
  resolves `google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h` to torch's old copy →
  `PROTOBUF_NODISCARD`/`PROTOBUF_PREDICT_FALSE`/`uint8_t` errors in xla_utils.cc.
  988b22f12 (rules_python 1.8.5 + patches, torch_headers depended on protobuf)
  compiles unsandboxed, which is why the chain branches and #6105 still build.
- VM supports user namespaces (`unshare -Ur true` ok). Fix to validate after the
  benchmark: `--config=wheel_common --remote_cache= --remote_executor=
  --google_default_credentials=false --spawn_strategy=linux-sandbox
  --strategy=linux-sandbox` (+ `--strategy=TestRunner=standalone` for TPU tests).
- Upstream's own "Build and Test Wheel against Local PyTorch" (local_torch.yml,
  run 42065483896 on 2c17e0797) fails with the identical error through
  `+torch_local_repo+local_torch/.../google/protobuf/stubs/stringpiece.h:188`,
  plus grpc layering-check errors. So it is an upstream bug for any standalone
  build — candidate fix PR (drop torch's protobuf dir from the include path, e.g.
  copy headers into a tree without it, or add protobuf's include first). Not acted
  on; one PR at a time and the user approves outward actions.

## 2026-11-05 ~18:50 UTC — scalar-cache benchmark done; follow-up PR #6277 opened

- Results (v6e-1, base 988b22f12 + 1e71c2b51; bench_results/): sweep = noise
  everywhere, dropped. twogen: hits unchanged; 1500-cycle dispatch p50 31→10.6 us
  (DEFER_NEVER) and 32→9.4 us, 48.6→33.5 us/op (DEFER_AND_FUSE); fused region
  across eviction 417→390 us and +1→0 compiles; AdamW+cosine unchanged; live
  buffers for 4000 distinct scalars +1952 vs +928. Scalar tests 5/5 on TPU.
- User chose PR over comment. Pushed scalar-cache-twogen (6c3b10d7e, rebased on
  a43dc0aba, authored joinalahmed, Assisted-by only) to fork; opened
  https://github.com/google-pytorch/torch_tpu/pull/6277 referencing #6037/#6102,
  with an explicit reviewer question (2048 bound vs two generations of 512).
- Chain restarted by job3 trap at 18:25 UTC with all seven branches.

- 19:05 UTC: user asked to remove the Assisted-by line and never add attribution again. Stripped from the #6277 commit (head now 4f4ce1718, force-pushed with lease) and PR body. No attribution lines on any commit or PR body from now on. #6105 still carries Assisted-by lines; not rewritten.
